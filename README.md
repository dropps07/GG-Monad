# GG MONAD

## Play-to-Earn Gaming Platform on Monad Blockchain

GG MONAD is a skill-based competitive gaming platform built on the Monad blockchain where players can earn real rewards through mini-games. Inspired by platforms like MPL and Winzo, our platform enables users to compete in simple yet engaging games with entry fees, creating prize pools where winners earn real value in the form of MON tokens.

## ðŸŽ® Project Overview

GG MONAD serves as a trustless intermediary, leveraging Monad blockchain for transparent and secure prize distribution. Players convert MON into platform points, which they use to enter competitive game rooms. After competing in skill-based mini-games, winners receive prize pools (minus a small platform commission).

### Target Audience
- Casual gamers looking for competitive play with real rewards
- Crypto enthusiasts interested in gaming applications
- Mobile gamers familiar with skill-based competition
- Monad blockchain community members
